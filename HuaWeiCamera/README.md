## Intoduction to this project

this is a little project that uses wxWidgets to write a monitor, which can detect how many people are in a room;

In this project I use the API of HuaWei Camera, the model of D2150-10-SIU, for getting the realtime meta data, then resolve meta data exracting the number of people who are entering or exiting the room. after data resolved, I use wxWidgets to write a Simple GUI to diaplay all the useful information required.
